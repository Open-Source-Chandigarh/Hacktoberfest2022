          <h2>General Information about Hunting Dogs</h2>
          <p>The Welfare of Stray Dogs is a Kaliyaganj-based organization working to eradicate rabies and control the
            street-dog population in a humane, scientific way.</p>
          <p>We have recently launched our Senior Care Program which is very close to our hearts. Since the start of our
            recovery centre we have seen many senior dogs come through our doors. Most of these dogs are unable to
            survive on the streets due to their age and health issues that come along with it.</p>
          <h2>REHOMING PROGRAM</h2>
          <p>
            Our charity since inception has focused on rehoming street puppies, kittens and abandoned animals. Most of
            the puppies and kittens born on the streets learn from their mother at a young age how to survive on the
            streets. But ever so often there are those that get separated from the mother and even some who get injured
            and are unable to survive on the streets without our help. There are also animals that of no fault of their
            own are abandoned on the streets by their families and left to fend for themselves. Our team take in these
            animals and help them become healthy physically, emotionally and fit for rehoming. We then work with
            behaviourist and help match the personalities of each animal and place in them forever loving homes.

          learner and gets along with other dogs as well. She is healthy, sterilised and vaccinated.</p>
        ANIMAL BIRTH CONTROL
